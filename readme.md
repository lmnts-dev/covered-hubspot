# Covered Hubspot Email Builder
Made in Jekyll

## To Run
`bundle install`

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Fire up an .ngrok server to test on your devices
  - You can access your ```localhost:4000``` from any device because ```.ngrok``` is amazing.
  - In the ```/_ngrok/``` folder you'll find a .zip file with .ngrok in it. Install that.
  - In terminal, simply type ```$ ./ngrok http 4000``` to fire up a server and they will provide urls.
  - Be sure that if you are on development and potentially behind a directory such as ```/covered-hubspot/```, you'll have to append that to your .ngrok url.
